Unicorn Jump

Description:
“Unicorn Jump” is based off of the Google Dinosaur Game, but with additional unique features. The user will feel the game is more personalized as they have more choices to choose from than the original game. Additionally, the bonus lives add an extra challenge and goal to the user’s experience. 

Objective:
The user must try to avoid the obstacles as much as possible and collect as many coins as possible. The objective of the game is to get as high of a score as possible. 

Gameplay, In Detail:
On the main screen, the user has an option between a classic unicorn sprite and a dinocorn sprite, in honour of the inspiration for the game. To select a sprite, the user must click on one with their mouse. Once they’ve chosen a sprite, the user must use their mouse and click the start button. 

There are two other buttons, in addition to the start button. There is the rules button, which will bring the user to a page that has all the rules in point form. Moreover, there is the credits button, which brings the user to a page with the names of the people who were part of creating the game (the coder - Tanya, and the teacher - Mr. Chow). From both of these pages, there is a button labelled, “Back”, that allows the user to go back to the main screen.

Once the game has started, the sprite will continuously run. The user will encounter various obstacles and have to avoid them by jumping over them, clicking the “w” key, or ducking under them, using the “s” key. The obstacles include upside-down ice cream cones (they act as spikes) and flying pigs. As the game progresses, the obstacles will come faster and faster.

Additionally, the user can collect coins, which provide extra lives. These extra lives are useful because if the user were to hit an obstacle while having an extra life, they’d still be in the game. When the user collects a coin, they will see a bonus life screen, featuring a happy unicorn and dinocorn floating in the sky and the words “bonus life”. This screen will go away after a second and the user will return to the in-game state. 

When an obstacle is hit, the user will either go to the game over screen, which will feature an animation of the unicorn and dinocorn shaking their heads, or the user will see the high score screen. The user will be transported to this screen when they receive a new high score, and they will see an excited unicorn and dinocorn. 

From there the user will be brought back to the main screen, after a few seconds, where they can choose a different character, or keep the same one, and play again!

Rules, Condensed (Closer to what you’d see in the actual rules screen):
Select a sprite, the classic unicorn or the dinocorn
Press “Start” to start playing
Jump over obstacles by pressing the “w” key
Duck under obstacles by pressing the “s” key
Collect coins to earn a bonus life
Try and get the highest score possible

Colour Scheme:
This game features pastel or softer colours, making the game feel lighthearted and fun. Additionally, pastel colours fit with the unicorn theme of the game as unicorns are often associated with pastels. The dinocorn also has softer colours than your average dinosaur. Not only does this allow the dinocorn to fit in more, it adds to the sense of unseriousness. Moreover, the sprites and obstacles are outlined in black, while the background isn’t to allow them to pop out more. This will make it easier for the user to pay attention to the objects that are in constant motion.
